## 🎯 Goal and Skills

The goal of this project is to create a playable version of Rock, Paper, Scissors that:

- Prompts the user for input  
- Randomly generates a computer choice  
- Compares both choices to determine the winner of each round  
- Keeps track of scores over 5 rounds  
- Declares an overall winner at the end

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

- Writing functions to modularize logic  
- Using `prompt()` and `console.log()` for input/output  
- Using `Math.random()` to simulate computer choice  
- Implementing case-insensitive string handling  
- Using `if...else` and logical operators for decision making  
- Working with variables and loops  
- Managing global and local scope  
- Tracking and updating scores during gameplay 
- Using `trim()` to remove extra space
- Using `toUpper()` and `toLower()` for case insensitive
